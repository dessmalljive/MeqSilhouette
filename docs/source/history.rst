2.0 (2019)
----------

* Depend mainly on WSClean for forward modelling (MeqTrees only for txt sky models)
* Full polarimetric simulations
* Simulate time-variable sources
* Add complex time-variable antenna gains
* Add complex bandpass gains
* Add frequency-dependent polarization leakage
* Add parallactic angle rotation (write visibilities in both antenna and sky frames)
* Improve pointing error module
* Improve tropospheric corruption and thermal noise modules
* Add plotting modules
* Remove scattering screen
* Add python 3 support
* Refactor code for seamless integration within pipelines such as SYMBA

Integration with Pipelines
==========================

MeqSilhouette can be used in tandem with other radio astronomy simulation/calibration software packages in software pipelines for data synthesis/reduction/analysis.

Currently, the *SYnthetic Measurement creator for long Baseline Arrays* or `SYMBA <https://bitbucket.org/M_Janssen/symba/>`_  pipeline uses MeqSilhouette for synthetic data generation for
the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).
